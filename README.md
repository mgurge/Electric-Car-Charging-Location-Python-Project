# Electric-Car-Charging-Location-Python-Project

In this project I analyzed census data by block group and county subdivision in Connecticut to see whether people that live near electric car charging locations could afford an electric car. The visualizations include Connecticut routes and railroads to see where these stations are located in accordance to transportation locations. The later part of the project focuses on Hartford. 
The 2020 census variables used in this project were:
-Population Density
-Educational Attainment
-Unemployment
-Civilian population employed
-White alone
-Hispanic alone
-Asian alone
-Black alone
-Civilians that did not work from home with a commute less than 10 minutes
-Civilians that did not work from home with a commute less than a 40 to 59 minutes
